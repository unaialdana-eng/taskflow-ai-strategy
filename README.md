|------|-------------|

## Key Findings

- **100% of analyzed competitors** have shipped AI features
- Market is shifting from "AI-assisted" to "AI-autonomous" (agentic) paradigm
- Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise apps will embed AI agents by end of 2026

## Strategic Recommendation

**Fast Follower with Differentiation** - Implement core AI table stakes while building differentiated capabilities in underserved areas:

1. **Customer-Facing AI** - No competitor does this well
2. **SMB-Accessible Agents** - Autonomous AI not gated to Enterprise
3. **Predictive Project Health** - True predictive analytics

## Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Q1-Q2 2026 | Foundation (chat, summaries, writing) |
| Phase 2 | Q2-Q3 2026 | Differentiation (customer-facing AI, predictive health) |
| Phase 3 | Q4 2026+ | Agentic capabilities (autonomous agents) |
