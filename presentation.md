# Market Gaps Identified

1. **Customer-Facing AI** - No competitor does this well
2. **Predictive Project Health** - True predictive analytics underdeveloped
3. **SMB-Friendly Agents** - Autonomous AI gated to Enterprise tiers
4. **Industry-Specific Templates** - Generic implementations dominate
5. **AI Transparency** - Audit trails & explainability underserved

---

# Strategic Options

| Option | Description | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **A. Feature Parity** | Match all competitor features | Not recommended |
| **B. Niche Specialization** | Focus on one vertical | Secondary |
| **C. Fast Follower + Differentiation** | Core features + unique capabilities | **Recommended** |

# Recommended Strategy

## Fast Follower with Differentiation

**Core principle:** Don't chase parity. Own underserved segments.

**Primary differentiators:**
1. **Customer-Facing AI** - AI for client communication & stakeholder updates
2. **SMB-Accessible Agents** - Autonomous AI not gated to Enterprise
3. **Predictive Project Health** - True predictive analytics
